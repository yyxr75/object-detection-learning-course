# MMW_CASCADE_2243_Radar_Signal_Process

This repository is a TI mmwave cascade 2243 4d radar project. It has some properties below:

1. It is a matlab demo

2. It implemented some DBF algorithm

Things left to do:

1. Merge the static range-azimuth map with dynamic one.

2. Performance of compress sensing AoA algorithm is not as expected.

3. Develop this device as a ros node for later data capturing.
